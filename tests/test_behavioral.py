"""
Behavioral E2E Tests — Long-Running Multi-Turn Conversations
===============================================================

These tests run against LIVE Neo4j + Ollama to verify that the brain
actually performs like a mind over time. Each test simulates a multi-turn
conversation and validates behavioral properties.

Markers:
    @pytest.mark.behavioral — marks long-running tests (~1-3 min each)

Run:
    pytest tests/test_behavioral.py -v -s --timeout=300
